Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

I changed the edge class so that it doesn't compare destinations, since now because of generics, the destinations aren't required to be comparables.
destinations and edge labels are not required to be comparable.
used a comparator in hw5 and hw6 scripttestdrivers and the bfs algorithm because the nodes and edges are no longer comparable.
no more compareto() in edge.java
